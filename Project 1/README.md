# Housing Prices
Essentially, all houses in this situation follow the pattern: Price = `50K + 50K * number of beds`
Example: If I have a house with 1 bedroom, that would cost $100,000;
         If I have a house with 2 bedrooms, that would cost $150,000; and so on

My goal in this simple application will be to use Tensorflow and python to print out what the price of a 7 bedroom house would be.

Important lesson: Since Tensorflow depends a lot more on probability than being exact, the value will be very close to $400,000 but not exactly $400,000. Please print out value determined by running python script.
