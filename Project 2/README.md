# Handwriting Classifier

Similar to Fashion MNIST, we have an handwriting dataset in Keras called MNIST which has items of handwriting: the digits 0 through 9.

Write an MNIST classifier that trains to 99% accuracy or more and does so without fixed number of epochs. Please note that it should fulfill the following criteria:
(i) Succeed in less than 10 epochs; nothing greater than 10
(ii) When it reaches 99% or greater it should print out statement “Reached 99% accuracy so cancelling training!”
